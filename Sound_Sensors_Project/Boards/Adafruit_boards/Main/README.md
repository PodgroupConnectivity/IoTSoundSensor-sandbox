# LoRaWAN Noise Pollution meter (Adafruit Feather M0 + INMP441 + TTN)

Brief description and photos here. 

Highlight this is a LoRaWAN device and that the telemetry data (measurements) ends up on TTN Data Storage. Put a snapshot of TTN Data Storage displaying data reported and stored.

## Description

Long description. 

Explain how the software contains some parameters to control the frequency of samples, sleep time and so.

## Hardware

For this project I used the following hardware:

* Here comes ...
* ... a series of bullet points ...
* ... with every piece of hardware ...
* ... used and a link to a shop where ...
* ... we can buy it.

Explain we're using an Adafruit Feather M0 clone but you can use the official one as well.

## Wiring

Photos an details about how to wire hardware components

## Software

Detail how to prepare the Arduino IDE to be able to compile and flash the board:

* Describe which board to use from Arduino Board Manager
* Describe the libraries used you need to download from Arduino Libraries Manager

## TheThingsNetwork

Detail here how to add the device to a TTN Application (create app, create device, grab keys, write keys on arduino sketch).
Detail then how to integrate the TTN Application with TTN Data Storage.
